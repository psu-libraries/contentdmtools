# OCLC CONTENTdm Custom Files
 * psu_cdm_style.css
 * psu_cdm_scripts.js

### Notes, tips, and tricks

  * Files and scripts to customize hosted CONTENTdm must be uploaded through the [Website Configuration Tool](https://cdm17287.contentdm.oclc.org/login/configtool). After logging in, use the left-sidebar (global or collection-level as needed) to expand the "Custom" section to perform whatever actions are necessary.
  * After uploading a file, you need to save and the publish to affect the changes. Generally, you will want to preview the changes first. Note: it is sometimes necessary to rename the file to affect the change. Adding the current date is good, if you need to after that, try letters. When saving the cannonical version here, please do not change the filename.
